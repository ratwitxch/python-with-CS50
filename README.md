# python-with-CS50
My not so beginner code from learning python with CS50's python course (;

# HELLO WORLD!
At the end of 2022, I started learning Python with Sololearn. It was boring and I had to push myself EVERYDAY to even do a few lessons. Not fun /:

I went on and off on it for about a year, at some point I finished the "Intro to Python" course but at that point I felt too unmotivated to go any further. Then... I GOT TO USE MY MOM"S FRICKIN LAPTOP. 

I thought to myself, "**Finally** I can actually code and use it for realzzz." 

Setupped _Python, VScode_ and even _obsidian_ UWU. Went on learning from videos but I still found it hard AF. With having to apply for Uni and all the exams at the end of high school I swept coding to the sidelines until March 2024. And I found CS50's course through a vid. After a few minutes, I got hooked cuz of how much stuff I didn't know Python could do :3 

Lol this readme is more like a diary but congratz if you've read this far!
Happy ravels on thy Journey..
